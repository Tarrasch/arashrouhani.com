# Master thesis

My greatest academic contribution as of yet is my master thesis. I embarked on
the topic of **Stack Traces for Haskell**. [[PDF]][master-thesis] (April 2014)

[master-thesis]: /papers/master-thesis.pdf

The implementation came to completion after the master thesis was written
[(documentation)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.9.1.0/docs/GHC-ExecutionStack.html).
After some refining of my code on my spare time, I sent a few patches for
review.  While the patches did not meet the bar, an active GHC Contributor, Ben
Gamari, took on the challenge to rewrite and productionize my prototype which
eventually got merged. The big picture roadmap is available on [GHC's
wiki](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/DWARF/Status).
