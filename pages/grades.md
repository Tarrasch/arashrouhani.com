Every now and then, some companies want to know my Grade Point Average (GPA) as
part of the recruitment process.

Just to simplify for myself and the recruiters, I publish this information here.

 * 2014, [Masters degree]
     * Chalmers - 4.67/5.00 (My calculation)
     * 2013, [Georgia Tech] - 3.87/4.00 (see attachment)
 * 2012, [Bachelors degree] - 4.63/5.00 (My calculation)
 * 2009, [High School] - 17.4/20.0 (My calculation)

[Masters degree]: /grades/cth_masters.pdf
[Georgia Tech]: /grades/gt_transcript.pdf
[Bachelors degree]: /grades/cth_bachelors.pdf
[High School]: /grades/ubg_highschool.pdf

Note that I've only done my own calculation when the university does not
provide calculated GPAs.

Feel free to use this information or forward this page to anyone. You have my persmission. :)
