# My CV in typst

The advantage with this is that I can send diffs to friends
after they've corrected my CV, and they can comment online etc.

## Create the pdf

Screw it, just edit the CV [online](https://typst.app/) and commit it to `cv.typ` afterwards.
I used "Tinymyst Typst" vscode extension.

At the time of writing (Mar 2025), I failed to install the typst-cli, but the typst extension can generate the pdf file.

<!--
 1. Install Rust, see <https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install>.
 2. Install typst, `cargo install --locked typst-cli` -->
