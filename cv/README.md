The advantage with this is that I can send diffs to friends
after they've corrected my CV, and they can comment online etc.

Packages I installed on Debian work computer:

    canhaz texlive-base
    canhaz texlive-latex-base
    canhaz texlive-latex-recommended

I compile this with my own command from my dotfiles

    $ mkv
